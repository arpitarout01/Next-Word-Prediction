# Next Word Prediction using LSTM

This project implements a **Next Word Prediction** model using an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural network. Given a sequence of words, the model predicts the most likely next word. It is trained on a natural language corpus and can be used to generate or autocomplete text.

## Overview

The model uses:
- **Text preprocessing** for tokenization and sequence generation.
- An **LSTM-based neural network** to learn sequential patterns.
- **Keras/TensorFlow** for training and prediction.
